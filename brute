# BRUTE FORCE ATTACK

**Definition:** A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys.

**Example:** Trying out every combination on a keypad to a locked room, hoping that eventually youâ€™ll find the right one.

## CAUSES OF BRUTE FORCE ATTACK

### Weak Passwords:

- Use of easily guessable passwords.
- Lack of complexity or randomness in password creation.

### Predictable Passwords:

- Reliance on common words, phrases, or patterns.
- Absence of uniqueness in password choices.

### Lack of Security Measures:

- **No Account Lockout Policies:**
  - Failure to limit login attempts.
  - Allows attackers to repeatedly try different passwords without consequences.
- **No Multifactor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Missing an additional layer of security beyond passwords.
  - Increases vulnerability to unauthorized access.

## TYPES OF BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS

### Simple Brute Force Attacks:

- The attacker tries to logically guess a password by using common passwords or personal information.

### Dictionary Attacks:

- The attacker tests common words, phrases, or passwords in exhaustive combinations.

### Hybrid Brute Force Attacks:

- The attacker combines techniques from dictionary attacks and simple brute force attacks to test combinations involving both common words and random characters.

### Reverse Brute Force Attacks:

- The attacker starts with a known password and tests it against a list of possible usernames.

### Credential Stuffing:

- The attacker uses credentials that have already been stolen from another source and tests them against multiple sites.

## TOOLS USED TO EXPLOIT VULNERABILITY

- **Aircrack-ng:**
  - A suite of tools that assess Wi-Fi network security and can crack WEP and WPA passwords using brute force methods.
  
- **Hydra:**
  - A fast and flexible tool that can launch brute force attacks on various network services, such as FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, and more.

- **John the Ripper:**
  - A powerful tool that can crack encrypted passwords using brute force, dictionary, and rainbow table methods.

## HOW TO PREVENT BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS

- **Use Strong Passwords:**
  - Choose passwords that are long, complex, and unique.
  - Avoid using common words, phrases, or personal information.
  - Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

- **Use Multifactor Authentication:**
  - Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of verification, such as a code sent to your phone or email, a biometric scan, or a physical token.

- **Use a Password Manager:**
  - Store and manage your passwords securely in a password manager that can generate and autofill strong passwords for you.
